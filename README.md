Title: ABAW : FACIAL EXPRESSION RECOGNITION IN THE WILD

Abstract:The fifth Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild (ABAW) competition has multiple challenges
such as Valence-Arousal Estimation Challenge, Expression Classification Challenge, Action Unit
Detection Challenge, Emotional Reaction Intensity Estimation Challenge. In this paper we have
dealt only expression classification challenge using multiple approaches such as fully supervised,
semi-supervised and noisy label approach. Our approach using noise aware model has performed
better than baseline model by 10.46% and semi supervised model has performed better than baseline
model by 9.38% and the fully supervised model has performed better than the baseline by 9.34%.
